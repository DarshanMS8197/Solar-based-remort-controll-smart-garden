# GitHub Repository Contribution Stats Card

Copy and paste this into your markdown content, and that's it. Simple!

My project, which is based on [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats), focuses on showing GitHub repository contribution stats and applies the typescript to the original project. Refer to [ISSUE#2027](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/2027). Thank you [@anuraghazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra) for the awesome open-source project!

After I have applied this, I became enthusiastic about contributing to open source because I can see all my contributions in my Github Readme! If you guys star and let your friends know this, I really appreciate that!

Change the `?username=` value to your GitHub username.

```

### Demo

![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&hide=B)

\_Note: Available ranks are S+ (over 10000), S (over 1000), A+ (over 500), A (over 100), B+ (over 50) and B (over 1).

### Limiting contribution repos to show

To limit contribution repos to show, you can pass a query parameter `&limit=` with number value. For example, if you want to show only 5 contribution repos, then add **limit=5** like the following one.

```md
![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&limit=5)
```

### Hiding rank stats

To hide specific ranks, you can pass a query parameter `&hide=` with comma-separated rank values. If you need to add plus rank (ex. B+) to hide arrays , it is always safe to replace pluses with %2B

```md
![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&hide=B,B%2B)
```

### Showing contributor rank stats

To show contributor ranks, you can pass a query parameter `&hide_contributor_rank=false`.

```md
![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&hide=B,B%2B&hide_contributor_rank=false&limit=5)
```

### Configuring the sorting order for gitHub contributor stats

To specify the sorting order based on either contributions or star count, include the &order_by= query parameter with the options `stars` or `contributions` in your request URL.

```md
![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&hide=B,B%2B&hide_contributor_rank=false&limit=5&order_by=contributions)
```

### Including all contributions, not only recent contributions

By default, the card is generated from GitHub's GraphQL API `repositoriesContributedTo`, which only includes recent contributions. To include all contributions, add `&combine_all_yearly_contributions=true` query parameter, which will let the card be generated from GitHub's GraphQL API `contributionsCollection`, including all contributions.

```md
![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&combine_all_yearly_contributions=true)
```

### Themes

With inbuilt themes, you can customize the look of the card without doing any [manual customization](#customization).

Use `&theme=THEME_NAME` parameter like so :-

```md
![Taehyun's GitHub Repository Contribution stats](https://github-contributor-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HwangTaehyun&hide=B&theme=default)
```

#### All inbuilt themes:- in <a href="https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats">github-readme-stats' themes</a>

dark, radical, merko, gruvbox, tokyonight, onedark, cobalt, synthwave, highcontrast, dracula

You can look at a preview for [all available themes](./themes/README.md) or checkout the [theme config file](./themes/index.js) & **you can also contribute new themes** if you like :D

> Note: The minimum of cache_seconds is currently 4 hours as a temporary fix for PATs exhaustion.

## :sparkling_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

- Starring and sharing the project :rocket:
- You can make one-time donations via buymeacoffee. I'll probably buy a coffee! :coffee:
